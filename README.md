# 🌞 Summer Dev Challenges 2025

This repo documents my personal coding journey through **June and July 2025** as part of my summer development challenge. The goal: **build daily or weekly mini projects** to sharpen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## 📍 Context

I'm currently studying at **Helsinki Business College**, and these projects are a mix of:

* 🏫 **School assignments**
* 🧠 **Self-led learning challenges**
* 💡 **UI practice and frontend skills improvement**

## 🚧 Structure

Each week focuses on a specific theme:

* **Week 1:** HTML + CSS basics (cards, navbars, layouts)
* **Week 2:** CSS layout + JavaScript DOM interaction
* **Week 3+**: More advanced interactivity, animations, and real-world component builds

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
* JavaScript (DOM, Events, Interactivity)

## ✅ Goals

* Practice **building without tutorials**
* Improve **responsive design**
* Build a portfolio of **clean, reusable components**
* Document progress for personal growth and feedback
